# Adobe Creative Cloud
Adobe Creatice Cloud is a suite of tools which include:  
- Photoshop
- Illustrator
- Premiere Pro
- After Effects
- Audition
- Animate  
and more

The downside is that it is usually a monthly/yearly payment, and is not that cheap.

## How to get Adobe Creative Cloud for free (While you are a student)
To get Adobe Creative Cloud you will need to email ICT and ask for your edupass account.  
In a few (work) days you will recieve an email with your username and password.  
Now go to [Adobe's](https://www.adobe.com/au/) website, log in with your edupass account and download Creative Cloud Desktop,
from there you can download all the tools in Creative Cloud.

## Alternatives to Adobe Creative Cloud
Adobe Creative Cloud is very popular but there are free alternatives that you can use and wont disapear once you stop being a student.  
- GIMP (Photo Editor) (free & open source)
- Krita (Photo Editor but is also used for 2D animation and drawing) (free & open source)
- Inkscape (Vector Art) (free & open source)
- DaVinci Resolve (Video Editing, Color Grading and more) (There is a free version and a paid version, the free version has heaps of features)

I actually prefer DaVinci Resolve over Premiere Pro due to the more modern look, although you do lose some features such as being able to export 4k video
because its the free version. Another advantage is that it is an alternative to Premiere Pro, After Effects and Audition in one application.  

Blender is also a really good tool as its free & open source but has a huge feature set, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyJWoyVx_XI&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U&index=1)
