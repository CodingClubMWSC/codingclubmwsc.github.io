# IDEs
An IDE is a tool that makes writing code easier and faster. With features such as autocomplete and more it can speed up the process of making a program immensely.  
When picking an IDE there are alot of options and depending on what you are making and what features you want can affect which IDE is best suited for you.

## [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Visual Studio Code is a IDE made by Microsoft using electron.
While not having as many featues as other alternatives it has a huge market of extensions which contain features that can make coding a more pleasant experience.

PROS:
- Heaps of extensions
- Small download of less than 200MB (with a 500MB disk footprint)
- Lots of keyboard shortcuts that make writing code easier
- Supports lots of languages using extensions

CONS:
- Supports lots of languages with confusing extensions

I would highly recommend Visual Studio Code as a lightweight but powerful, jack-of-all-trades IDE.

## [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
Though it has a similar name to Visual Studio Code and is also made by Microsoft, Visual Studio is a very different IDE.  
It is not lightweight like VSCode, quite the opposite. Because it uses modules you can go from a relatively small 800MB to 210GB. 
(Although to get to 210GB you would need to download all the modules and there are quite alot.)  
Check the website to see if it has the tools you need.

PROS:
- Great for .NET (C#, F# etc.) 
- Has good debugging and profiling tools

CONS:
- Does not support as many languages as VSCode (You could classify this as a pro of Visual Studio)

I would recommend Visual Studio for .NET and other languages it supports as it has good debugging and profiling.

## Others
There are lots of other IDEs as well, a few examples are:
- [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) (Is paid but you can use [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get it for free while you are a student)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Like VSCode but open source)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) (Free and simple)
