# How to get started Coding
Here we will show you resources that you can use to get started or to level up your coding skills.  
(Note: The "Level" system is based on my opinion and is not 100% accurate, it only exists to show useful resources and a rough idea of where to start.)

## Level 0: How a computer thinks
Here are some resources you can use to start programming with no prior knowledge.  
Use these resources to learn how a computer "thinks" about its instructions.  
(eg. Follows instructions from top to bottom, etc)

### [Code.org](https://code.org/learn)
Activities here range from pre-reader to Grade 9+.
This website is a huge list of coding activities and includes some that we will mention later.
If you have no prior experience, basic knowledge or just want to find new resources [Code.org](https://code.org/learn) is a great website to use.

### Alternative: Apple Swift Playground
While only being an option if you have an apple device, Swift Playground is still a good choice if you enjoy puzzles. To get it download it from the App Store.

## Level 1: Make something yourself
More resources for people who have basic knowledge
Learn how to make something from scratch, with scratch.

### [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
Scratch is a drag and drop, block based programming language which you may have already used in digital tech.
Scratch has heaps of tutorials in the website that you can use or you could find some on google. 
Another great way to learn how to use Scratch is to go to a project and pressing "see inside" you can then see all the code that makes the project run,
try editing the project to change how things look and work.

## Level 2: Learn how to use Syntax and prep for beyond. 

### [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/)  
CodeCombat is a great resource for people who are transitioning into using syntax.  
CodeCombat is mainly a puzzle game, with code. It teaches you how to use either JavaScript or Python and makes you use it by completing puzzles.  
Once you reach a high enough skill level there is even a competition called "[CodeCombat AI League](https://codecombat.com/league)", 
where you can compete in a competitive AI battle simulator while learning Python and JavaScript.

## What to do next
After you have mastered the above you can move on to learn how to use languages in different ways.
